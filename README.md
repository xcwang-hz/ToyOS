# ToyOS
I am trying to create a toy os that can run on the web, on bochs and QEMU. It is mainly for learning and for fun. I will borrow idea and code from https://github.com/joelseverin/linux-wasm and https://github.com/SerenityOS. KISS ("Keep it simple, stupid") principle is adopted here, will only implement what is necessary so far, and will borrow the code in whole once fully understand the idea. 

Steps:
1. Display ToyOS on console
2. Draw a squre on the canvas
3. Simple echo functionality on console
4. Read from Initramfs file
5. Support directory tree in memory
6. Support both console and canvas
7. DOOM
