# ToyOS
I am trying to create a toy os that can run on the web, on bochs and QEMU. It is mainly for learning and for fun. I will borrow idea and code from https://github.com/joelseverin/linux-wasm and https://github.com/SerenityOS

Steps:
1. Display ToyOS
2. Implement echo functionality from bare metal
3. Put echo into user space
